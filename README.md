# Experiment-2-Fitting-Poisson-Distribution
Aim: 
To fit Poisson distribution for the arrival of objects per minute from the feeder. 
# Software required: 

Python and Visual Component Tool
# Theory: 

1. The Poisson distribution gives the probability of a number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space when events occur independently and at a constant average rate (λ).
2. The probability mass function (PMF) is:

3. Here, λ = mean number of occurrences, and e = 2.718 (base of natural logarithm).
4. The mean and variance of a Poisson distribution are both equal to λ.
5. Applicable when events occur independently, singly, and at a constant rate.
